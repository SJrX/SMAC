\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

This document is the manual for SMAC~\cite{HutHooLey11-SMAC} (an acronym for \emph{Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration}). SMAC aims to solve the following \emph{algorithm configuration} problem: Given a binary of a parameterized algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, a set of instances $\mathcal{S}$ of the problem $\mathcal{A}$ solves, and a performance metric $m$, find parameter settings of $\mathcal{A}$ optimizing $m$ across $\mathcal{S}$.

In slightly more detail, users of SMAC must provide:
\begin{itemize}
\item a parametric algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ (an executable to be called from
the command line), 
\item a description of $\mathcal{A}$'s parameters $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n$ and their domains $\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_n$, 
\item a set of benchmark instances, $\Pi$, and
\item the objective function with which to measure and aggregate algorithm preformance results.
\end{itemize}

SMAC then executes algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ with different \emph{parameter configurations} (combinations of parameters 
$\langle{}\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n\rangle{} \in \Theta_1 \times \cdots \times \Theta_n$, on instances $\pi \in \Pi$),
searching for the configuration that yields overall best performance across the benchmark instances under the supplied objective. For more details please see~\cite{HutHooLey11-SMAC}; if you use SMAC in your research, please cite that article. It would also be nice if you sent us an email -- we are always interested in additional application domains.

\subsection{System Requirements}

SMAC itself requires only Java 6 \footnote{Sun Java version 1.6.0\_23 or later recommended} or newer to run. 

SMAC is primarily intended to run on Unix like platforms, but now includes start up scripts so that it can run on Windows. In all the examples below you should add \texttt{.bat} to the end of every executable, for instance \texttt{./smac --scenario-file scen.txt --seed 1} becomes \texttt{smac.bat --scenario-file scen.txt --seed 1}.

Most of the included scenarios (in \texttt{./example\_scenarios/} require ruby and Linux 32-bit libraries to run. The scenarios in \texttt{./example\_scenarios/analytic/} use optimize functions internal to smac and are completely cross platform. There is one scenario for windows available currently in\texttt{example\_scenarios\textbackslash saps\textbackslash\saps-scenario-windows.txt}.
