We are indebted to Jonathan Shen for porting our random forest code from C to Java in preparation for a Java port of all of SMAC. We thank Marius Schneider for many valuable bug reports and suggestions for improvements. Thanks also to Chris Thornton for being a secondary beta tester.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Return Codes}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline
Value & Error Name & Description \\
\hline
\hline
0 & \textbf{Success} & Everything completed successfully \\
\hline
1 & \textbf{Parameter Error} & There was a problem with the input arguments or files  \\
\hline
2 & \textbf{Trajectory Divergence} & For some reason SMAC has taken a unexpected path \\

& & (\eg{} SMAC executes a run that does not match a run \\
& & in the \textbf{-~$\!\!$-runHashCodeFile}) \\
\hline
3 & \textbf{Serialization Exception} & A problem occurred when saving or restoring state \\
\hline
255 & \textbf{Other Exceptions} & Some other error occurred \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textsc{NOTE:} All error conditions for besides 255, are fixed. However in future some exceptions that previously reported 255 may be changed to a non 255 value as needed.

\subsection{Version History of Java SMAC}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Version 2.00] First Java release of SMAC (this is a port and extension of the original Matlab version).
	\end{description}
\subsection{Known Issues}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trajectory file does not output standard deviation
\item Using any alias for -$~\!$-showHiddenParameters, -$~\!$-help, or -$~\!$-version as values to other arguments (\eg{ Setting -$~\!$-runGroupName -$~\!$-help}) does not parse correctly (This is unlikely to be fixed until someone complains).
\item Using large parameter values in continuous integral parameters, may cause loss of precision, and or crashes if the values are too big.
\end{enumerate}
