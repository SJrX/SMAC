    the most widely used heuristic method for the traveling salesman problem
    (TSP). This paper presents an effective implementation of $k$-opt in LKH-2,
    a variant of the Lin-Kernighan TSP heuristic. The effectiveness of the
    implementation is demonstrated with experiments on Euclidean instances
    ranging from 10,000 to 10,000,000 cities. The runtime of the method
    increases almost linearly with the problem size. LKH-2 is free of charge for
    academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code.}",

    abstract = {{We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms, X, is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by \&\#8730;n, that is, the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous approaches.}},

These 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented {systems.--From} publisher description.},
