	SMAC uses slf4j (\url{http://www.slf4j.org/}), a library that allows for abstracting and replacing the logging system with ease, and uses logback (\url{http://logback.qos.ch/}) as the default logging system. While there is limited ability to change logging options via the command line (\eg{,\textbf{-$~\!$-logLevel},\textbf{-$~\!$-consoleLogLevel},\textbf{-$~\!$-logAllCallStrings},\textbf{-$~\!$-logAllProcessOutput}}), one can edit \texttt{conf/logback.xml}, to get much more control over the logging of SMAC. For more details of how to edit this file consult the logback documentation. 
	
	\textsc{Note:} If you replace the logger in SMAC or modify the configuration file, the logging command line options may no longer work.
